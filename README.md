About
----------
This game is a modern remake of asteroids for the Coder Girl projects. For those unfamiliar with the game Asteroids, Wikipedia describes it as:

"Asteroids is an arcade space shooter released in November 1979[1] by Atari, Inc. and designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh. The player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases."

Ruby is an easier-to-learn language that allows a person to start coding pretty quickly. Gosu and Chipmunk were used in order to help with the physics of the game. You will see it at work when those asteroids are shot and broken down. With Coder Girl mentor Ricky and Lamda Lounge mentor Jay, this project was also educational, and took approximately 13 weeks to finish.
